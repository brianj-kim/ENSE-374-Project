    -About Us-
	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p>None of us really like having all the responsibility on our shoulders. However we still want some level of control over our surroundings.
		We need something able to lessen responsibility by helping us with decisions. That's why we at TheyWill, have created this food generator,
		which can ease our load of decision making on a daily basis in a playful way. <br> <br> <br> <br>
